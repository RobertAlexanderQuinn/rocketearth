ROCKET EARTH
============

The worldâ€™s most comprehensive past, present & future rocket launch tracking app, complete 3D earth visualization, live streams, footage, mission summary, launch status & useful educational resources. For aerospace professionals & space enthusiasts alike.

It provides up-to-date launch windows, spaceport-related data, agencies, mission types, operators, payload information, launch probability, photos, live streams, mission details, educational links, live weather data, and more.

With the rising interest in space exploration and the technology behind it, Rocket Earth`s mission is to enable curious minds with the possibility to track, explore & see the latest information around the world related to space mission launches and revisit history through its complete mission archive.

Its easy-to-use 3D interactive interface enables children and adults alike to easily locate the nearest launch facilities, relive past missions all the way back to 1961 or learn about future launches as far into the future as agencies announce.

Rocket Earth uses a unique launch probability percentage algorithm and leverages data from weather systems (wind, water & temperature), magnetospheric plasma, solar wind, and misery maps.

Gathering launch data from all 36 Spaceports in 16 current launch-capable countries including 158 launch pads, Rocket Earth takes into consideration not only every major operator but also the lesser known and newest of our times.

Rocket Earth`s 3D visualizing engine seamlessly integrates thousands of real-time, worldwide data sources with a powerful, intuitive, responsive, and reliable web-based interface and data feeds to yield the most capable and useful launch tracking application and service.

Founded in 2018, Rocket Earth was the first company to offer free launch tracking services for both private and commercial launch traffic and aims to become the standard for enthusiasts and professionals alike, around the world.

*Launchlib* by Pete Riesett and Benjamin Higginbotham (of TMRO.tv). API repository of rocket launch information that application developers can use. The REST-based API allows developers to write powerful, striking applications and web pages that engage their community with the exciting world of space exploration without having to worry about maintaining the data themselves.

The data is maintained by a dedicated team of volunteers (Launch Librarians) from all over the world using verified first-party sources.

A visualization of global weather conditions forecast by supercomputers updated every three hours with ocean surface current estimates updated every five days, ocean surface temperatures and anomaly from daily average (1981-2011) updated daily, ocean waves updated every three hours, aurora updated every thirty minutes. The awesome [hint.fm wind map](http://hint.fm/wind/) and [D3.js visualization library](http://d3js.org) provided the main inspiration for this project.
